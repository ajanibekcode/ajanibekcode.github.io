Today marks the last first day of class as I will be graduating this semester. It amazes me how fast time flies...<br>
it feels like it was just yesterday when I enrolled into my first ever programming class, *COMP 110*, which was the catalyst
for my Computer Science career. 

<h3>Updates</h3>
I will continue being an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for COMP 110 and I am excited to continue helping others! I hope this
can be another successful semester of helping students learn basic git practices and also hope to prepare them well for exams by conducting review sessions.

In terms of classes, this will be the first time I am taking a Graduate-level course and I cannot wait to get started. The course is
titled *Using LLMs to Create Software* and I believe this will be a very useful class as I will gain more experience and understanding of Large Language Models, which is a vital skill with the ever-so shift in today's world with Artificial Intelligence.

<h1>I built a compiler!</h1>

<p>Specifically... built a functional compiler in Java capable of compiling a reduced Java grammar known as miniJava into x64 assembly targeting linux operating system. Performs lexical and contextual analysis using recursive descent and abstract syntax trees, followed by code generation that targets x86/x64 processors.</p>

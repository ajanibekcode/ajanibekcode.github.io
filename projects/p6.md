<h1>Carolina Akari</h1>

<p>Developed a Carolina-themed Akari puzzle game using Java, JavaFX, and Maven. Designed and implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns, enhancing code maintainability and scalability. Implemented various game functions such as allowing the user to randomize a puzzle to solve, cycle to the next or previous puzzle, and the option to reset the whole puzzle by clearing the game board.</p>

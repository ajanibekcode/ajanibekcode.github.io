<h1>Tetrashell</h1>

<p>Designed and developed a bash-like shell, 'Tetrashell', in a Unix environment using C, tailored towards interacting with Tetris quicksave files. Utilized pipes to establish communication channels between Tetrashell and external binaries and also leveraged fork and execve alongside to manage multiple processes and execute commands efficiently. Implemented features such as the undo command to revert the last modify operation and abbreviated commands to enhance user experience. Created a Makefile to automate the compilation and linking process for building the binary tetrashell and its supporting files.</p>

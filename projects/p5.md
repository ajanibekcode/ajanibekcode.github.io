<h1>2584</h1>

<p>Built a fully functional 2048 game using Swift and SwiftUI. Implemented the Fibonacci sequence by integrating the numbers as tile values and ensuring tiles could only merge if they were consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Utilized gesture recognizers to enable fluid tile movements via drag gestures, delivering a seamless and engaging user experience. Conducted thorough testing of the game on a iPhone 13 to ensure smooth performance and compatibility with the latest devices.</p>

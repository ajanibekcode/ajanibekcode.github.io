&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;31 Dec 2024 - Almaty, KZ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the year of 2024 comes to a close, I look at this year as another successful chapter in my life.
This was a challenging year, having taken compilers, computer vision, and machine learning to name
a few of the classes. Most importantly, I have decided to finally launch my personal website using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and the template inspired from Tom Preston-Werner which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://tom.preston-werner.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope by building this website, I can stay consistent when it comes to making blog posts and sharing my thoughts
on here! As of right now, my main focus is to continue building a project I hope to complete before the end of my last semester
at UNC Chapel Hill. I will also be taking a graduate seminar related to special topics in machine learning. I have many things
to learn and many things I am very excited to do; however, the one main lesson I will never forget is to take things one step
at a time. I hope this blog can help make your day as I share my experiences and provoking thoughts ðŸ˜„&lt;/p&gt;

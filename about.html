<div id="about">
  <h1>who am i?</h1>

<p>Current student at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel_Hill</a>, studying computer science.</p>

<p>My interests include cloud computing, software engineering, and machine learning, with a focus on building scalable, efficient solutions. 
Check out my blog on the home page where I take a closer look at these topics.</p>

<p>I love solving problems, but more importantly, I love to help others. As a current undergraduate teaching assistant, 
    I have had the pleasure of guiding students through a wide range of challenges, from conceptual topics like recursion and time complexity, 
    to more technical issues such as debugging containerization environments and resolving deployment problems with Docker.</p>
